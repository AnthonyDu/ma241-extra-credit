# ma241-extra-credit
This is an extra credit project for my Calculus II class that I took during the Spring 2022 semester at NC State University. It is a Python app that calculates an integral with numerical methods. My instructor was Nikki Xu and I ended up getting 3/3 points added to my final grade.
